Yoga Pose Recognition using Deep Learning  This is my college project where I built a *Yoga Pose Recognition system* using *Deep Learning* and *Computer Vision* techniques.
## üß† Project Description

The project aims to detect and recognize different *yoga poses* from real-time video or images using a webcam. It uses a *Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)* model trained on yoga pose datasets to identify poses like:

- Warrior Pose
- Tree Pose
- Cobra Pose
- Downward Dog

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- Python üêç
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
